Mello
Mello is a well-being and journaling web application created as part of my final year project. It combines a focus timer with journaling features, enabling users to log focus sessions, reflect on their progress, and link session notes to new or existing journal entries. Inspired by the Forest App, Mello features a serene, mindfulness-focused interface.

Features
Focus Timer: Track focus sessions and break times.
Journaling: Create, view, and manage journal entries.
Timer Integration: Link timer logs to journals for a seamless experience.
Optimized Performance: Refines algorithms and data structures to optimize query searches for journals and timer logs.
Local-First Design: All data is stored locally for privacy and ease of use.
Purpose
Mello encapsulates everything Iâ€™ve learned about full-stack development, from designing databases and refining algorithms to building user-friendly interfaces and optimizing system performance. This project highlights my ability to create a complete web application, balancing functionality and efficiency.
